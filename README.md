numbergame
==========
7-5-13

Here are many versions of a number game I got the idea for from a Ruby course on iTunes U. I basically started with the simple version of the assignment and started to add more complex workings...like the class and methods. Many thanks to Joey Shipley who got me past the class/method hurdle around version 7. Every version since then is my own creation - for better or worse.

The latest thing I'm trying to accomplish is putting the 'game_run' method into its own module. I thought I had this figured out after going through the Pragmatic Studios Ruby course a few times, but I just can't get it to work (see version 15, I think).

I hope to look back on this project someday as the beginning of my programming career.
